# Moz's Algorithm Handbook 
Together, land on dream jobs in the world of software enginerring!

## Who is this handbook for ?
This handbook is made for beginners who just start learning computer programming and algorithms. Also, this handbook is intended to become a high-quality resource for newbies who are preparing for coding interviews, just like me.

## What coding languagues is this handbook written in ?
**Java & Python**. These will provide you with examples in both static-typed and dynamic-typed (duck-typed) styles. Most of the cases discussed will come with Python code and test cases first. (Since I am writing these by mostly by myself, it is quite difficult to cover both Java and Python part simultaneously T_T)

## How to use this handbook?
Rules are simple. (1) Read the question. (2) Think about it for about 15 minutes (3) Implement your idea. (4) Run test cases (5) Check analysis.md and the code (6) Discuss it with your friends, if possible.
